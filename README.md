### Hi , I'm **Nithin P**

I'm an Analog/Mixed signal IC Designer. My Research interests include Ultra-low-power data converters, Biomedical circuits & wearable sensors.
  
- I have worked on Analog Blocks such as Switched-Capacitor Amplifiers, Ring Amplifiers, Filters, LDOs, BGRs, OTAs.
- I have worked on 55 to 180nm nodes.
- My primary interests outside circuit design lie in macroeconomics and data-driven quantitative analysis of business decisions, especially with the use of ML to large-scale economic and financial datasets.
- Outside work I'm a fan of Succession, The Office, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, HBO-Rome and Dexter: Resurrection TV shows.
